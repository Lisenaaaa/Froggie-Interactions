<h1>Beebot</h1>
<p>Beebot is my pride and joy. My protige, shall you say. I have been working on them for over 3 months, they evolved from my first, deprecated v12 bot, Aquabot (RIP) who I scrapped to completely rewrite because I was too lazy to learn how to change her code to v13. Beebot uses regular commands, however Beebot Dev, who I am still currently working on, uses slash commands. Beebot is a every-purpose, fun bot, intended to limit the number of bots you need in your server by having zero paid features and taking all the features from every bot imagineable and shoving them into one. All my other bots have been merged into one, with additional features only available on Beebot. If you want Pronoun Bot, but you also want Hydration Homie, have no fear! Beebot is here.</p>
